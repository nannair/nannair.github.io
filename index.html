						<!-- Interest in IT -->
							<article id="interest-in-it">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></p>
								<p>My interest and enthusiasm in IT ranges from interactive media and game development, since I very much enjoy watching gameplays, watching the process by which games are created, and playing them as well. My interest in IT began when I watched the gameplay for ‘Beyond: Two Souls’, a video game developed by Quantic dream. It was picturesque and had a very interesting premise; but what more mesmerized me was the fact that they used real actors and green-screened props in order to create and entire environment and different characters. I was only 13 years old at that time, and I had been inspired to learn CGI and/or the programming that went with creating 3D video games. My experience first started when I was around 5 years old, when I used to play educational games, which were all developed, in the early 90s, from one single brand called Knowledge adventure. It then continued on to flash games, which are still found on websites such as nitrome, miniclip, etc. A gaming platform called Steam had then raised in popularity around 2014/2015, and that was when I started to game on the PC. The rest of my experiences also range from Microsoft applications when doing school project work, and also adobe photoshop for digital drawing.</p>
								<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
								<p>RMIT is in the top 1% of the best universities in the world, and is specialized in technology, which is the field I am highly interested in. Studying in the city also sounds very exciting, even if it takes a long time to travel to the campus. The professors were also said to be very helpful and passionate about the subject they are teaching, as well as the tutors who assist students during their tute labs and practicals. They also seem to have a games and interactive media course linked to the Information Technology program, which I am keen on joining in my second year, if it is possible. RMIT is the best for graphics, design, and technology, and those are three areas I want to excel in, since I am very interested in them. </p>
								<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
								<p>From my studies, I expect to learn how to program at least a 2-D platformer video game, and create large interactive virtual environments. I want to be able to make a video game that is story-based, with interactive non-player characters and items, as well as learn how to work as part of a team of video game developers in order to create one huge project. A huge accomplishment would be to learn teamwork and cooperation when working with people you are not familiar with. I aim to improve my communication skills, and also extend my creativity past its boundaries.</p>

						<!-- Ideal Job -->
							<article id="ideal-job">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/jobsc.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This job is appealing to me, mostly since it has a very relaxed approach and the working hours are flexible. Pressure and stress often stunt my creativity, so a relaxed environment would easily encourage me fulfill my goals at a faster rate with more precision. This job also mentions working in a team, which is something else that I enjoy doing, especially with those who have the same mindset as me, such as artists and game designers.</p>
								<p><b>What are the skills I currently have?</b></p>
								<p>Despite not having experience, I have a very positive outlook when it comes to working with teams, and I am also able to clearly communicate with and listen to everyone within the team in order to find out what they require for a certain project. I also have effective problem-solving skills and experience with design apps such as Adobe Photoshop.</p>
								<p><b>What are the skills required for this position?</b></p>
								<p>There are many skills required for this position, but they are mainly looking for experience with IT systems. Jobs like these also often look for a positive attitude toward others and when in a team. They are also looking for people who have worked with two-dimensional web games before and are able to work with databases.</p>
								<p><b>How will I get the skills needed for this position?</b></p>
								<p>I will make an effort to intern in IT companies, and also try my hand at any group projects which arise within this course. Outside of that, I try to sign up for activities which require me to improve my flexibility and communication skills with people of other backgrounds and personalities, in order to understand them better.</p>

						<!-- Personal Profile -->
							<article id="personal-profile">
								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<p><b>MBTI:</b>INTP</p>
								<p><b>Learning Style:</b>Visual Learner</p>
								<p><b>Career Personality:</b>Enjoys freedom, innovation, and flexibility</p>
								<p><b>What do the results mean for me?</b></p>
								<p>These results give me a better idea as to what kind of career is suited for me. Even if these aren’t a complete representation of my personality, I am able to relate to a few traits, such as “logical” and “looking for freedom”. These results also give me an idea of what exactly to work on to improve my attitude; since INTP’s are known for being quiet and introverted, I would need to open up and talk to more people in order to get their preferences.</p>
								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
								<p>It states that INTPs needs to be present the right conditions to perform their best -- one of which are freedom. I would need a team that does not put too much pressure on me, or control me in the way I do things. However, I probably do not get to choose who I work with, therefore these results show me what I should probably work on to get along well with my team. I’d probably be very aloof and tend to work separately from the rest of my teammates, but that should not matter if I am able to get the job done perfectly and right.</p>
								<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
								<p>Being in a team with people of different personalities is what would make the perfect team. Personalities with opposing traits would easily get along each other, and push each other to do things which the other would usually not be comfortable with. This tests flexibility, but also helps maintain the entertainment ‘element’ that comes from group projects. For example, an extrovert would push an introvert to communicate their ideas more often, thus increasing the options for methods to reach their goals.</p>

						<!-- My Idea -->
							<article id="my-idea">
								<h2 class="major">My Idea</h2>
								<p><b>Overview</b></p>
								<p>My idea involves the creation of an 8-bit mobile game which relies on the player getting out of the house, much like Pokemon go. Much like modern games, there are different ranks that a player can achieve by leveling up, but they would need to battle with other players in order to do so. It would be a fantasy game with a rather simple artistic style, especially in the battle screen, which is inspired by Mortal Kombat and the game boy Pokemon games. This game would be aimed at youth from ages ten to eighteen, as well as adults, since there would be little to no fantasy violence within the game.</p>
								<p><b>Motivation </b></p>
								<p>The motivation behind this game was because of the increase prevalence of obesity within countries such as Australia and the United States. Statistics show that if the population reduced their body mass index by 1*, fourteen percent of the burden of disease in the future could be avoided. Walking around in order to search for battles would give a substantial workout to those who play, instead of them staying at home in order to wait for online matches. This would also motivate the players to create more real-life connections, rather than making (possibly unsafe) virtual connections from other countries. This could be especially good for modern youth, considering they tend to spend more time at home, on their laptops.</p>
								<p><b>Description</b></p>
								<p>There are many services that collaborate to make this game, and it seems to be a rather complex project. Much like any combat-type game, there will be multiple champions for a player to choose from and to purchase with in-game money -- all of these would be inspired by fantasy creatures, such as elves, mages, vampires, et cetera. The players would have to physically get out of their house and communicate with others in order to level themselves up, otherwise they are able to battle with bots, which would earn them in-game currency, but will not give them experience points in order to level up.</p>
								<p>These battles would have the same format as a Pokemon battle, with four choices -- two attack, and two defenses. One move would be a power move that lands critical hits but can only be used when a certain bar is at its maximum. During each turn, both players would choose an option, and when the time is up, their moves will be displayed, and according to their moves, their health will either decrease or stay the same. There will be three rounds, and the winner will gain more experience points than the loser. These experience points can be utilized to purchase more powerful champions.</p>
								<p>Initiating battle is where NFC comes in -- by tapping one’s phone against another player’s phone, they immediately go into a champion select screen, in which they can choose a character to fight as. They are able to exit, but only with the permission of the second player. A five-second timer would be displayed on screen when a player has not responded in a while; the reason it is so short is because these competitions are active, and much like the old board game, Battleships, each player is sitting substantially close to each other while engaging in battle. Switching off the Bluetooth during this battle would also immediately exit a player out of the game, and thus, give them an ‘away from keyboard’ or ‘AFK’ warning; after five warnings, a player will have a certain waiting time if wanting to engage in bot battles.</p>
								<p>There will be a GPS which utilizes a player’s current location in order to find new opponents; theirs would be tagged with their avatar and arrow over their location. Within the in-game map, recognized landmarks will act as ‘stations’ from which people can stand a chance to win items such as armor, health potions, or mana potions.</p>
								<p>In-game items, which can be won from landmarks or purchased from the store, are equipment that can be used during a battle or equipped before a battle. These items often mess with the stats of a character. For example, armor can be equipped before a battle (chosen to equip within the champion select screen) and will increase the defense of the player; unfortunately, it can only be used for one entire battle. Other items such as health and mana potions would be utilized during a battle and would be a ‘use item’ choice. If they choose this, they cannot attack or defend. </p>
								<p>Other notable features include in-game chat to message friends, and information boxes for each character.</p>
								<p><b>Tools and Technologies</b></p>
								<p>One of the main technologies which are needed in order to make this is Near Field Communication, which is a wireless protocol, similar to Bluetooth, it can be used to exchange information between two devices. Unlike its traditional use of data transfer, this chip would be used to immediately connect two devices to each other via Bluetooth. However, this game relies on both phones to have an NFC chip, otherwise, the phones can be connected manually via phone settings. GPS would also be another key technology, since it is needed to track the locations of players -- location would have to be switched on in order for tracking to work.</p>
								<p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
								<p>Knowledge of programming is required to make this game, which included fluency in Java and Python -- these would be the main bases of creating the entire video game, including every command, action, and option. A team member also needs to be able to manage the database of the game, since players would have to make an account in order to play and track their progress. Lastly, graphic designers are needed in order to create characters, environments, and the overall colorful visuals of the video game. Since the game is 2-D, they would need to know how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator in order to create logos and characters.</p>
								<p><b>Outcome</b></p>
								<p>The main outcome I am aiming for with this video game is to motivate people to engage with their community and get out of their rooms more. Those who play this game would easily connect with their neighbors and would also allow families to spend time together. Unlike other violent video games, this game would not negatively impact the psyche of growing teenagers, since the art style is far from realistic and does not involve them yelling curse words to strangers they have never met. Adults who are desperate to move up to better ranks (which easily comes with games like these) would take effort to manually travel to the nearest ‘stations’ or player.  </p>
